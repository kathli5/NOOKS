# NOOKS
**Intro**

This is the github repository for NOOKS, an app created by Alyssa Lima, Thea Feldgoise, Anna Zhou and Katherine Li. The goal of NOOKS is to create a community collection of study spaces, by and for Wellesley students! This app allows users to search, add, review and favorite study spaces in and around Wellesley. 

Our code is in the account _nooks_ in the directory _alpha_. 

**Alpha Version: Features Still in Progress**
- Map View: pinning nook locations on to the map, with clickable info windows that bring the user to the nook page. Also fixing WAVE errors on map features.
- Standardizing noise level language, and the way it appears in the search, add nook, and review forms.
- Creating boxes for reviews, to display more info besides the comment
- Adding more CSS styling to pages
